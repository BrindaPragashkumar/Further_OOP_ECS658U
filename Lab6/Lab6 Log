Exercise 1: Implement Rectangle and Polygon (3)
● 1 mark for Rectangle
● 1 mark for Polygon area
● 1 mark for Polygon perimeter

output:
Screenshot//

Exercise 2: Visual Shapes (3)
The exercise now is to take the basic shapes and develop graphical versions.
Marking scheme:
● 1 mark: fix centre offset in DrawablePolygon
● 1 mark: implement DrawableRectangle
● 1 mark: implement DrawableCircle


● What (if any) advantage is there to have a Tile class?
Tile class encapsulates the details of a tile.
The Tile class inherits functionality from DrawablePolygon, promoting code reusability.

An alternative to consider: we could just use DrawablePolygon and call the Geometry methods directly.

● What is the time complexity of testing the following given a polygon or polygons with N
vertices?:

○ Whether a polygon contains a point
O(N)
○ Whether a polygon intersects another polygon
n**2
○ The area of a polygon
O(N)
